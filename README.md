# Line Follower and Sumo Robot (Arduino)
This is the source code that my team created as a part of selection phase of Universitas Indonesia Robotics Team<br/>
The robot is using arduino uno and have 2 (two) motors<br/>
We use this <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=braulio.calle.bluetoothRCcontroller&hl=en">android app</a> to control the robot (via bluetooth)
